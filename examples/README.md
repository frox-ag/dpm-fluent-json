# Example processes for dpm-json

Note: These example processes are expected to be run in a Springboot environment. If you want to run them in a different environment, please
change any occurrence of ***dpmJson()*** to ***dpmJson.wrap()***.

In these three example processes we'll show you different aspects of dpmJson, including:

- attribute access
- list usage
- map usage

For every process there is an actual implementation containing the solution (-SOLUTION.bpmn) and a version of the process for you to
implement it yourself.

To see the outcome of your code just assign the result of your script to the variable *result* and check the Camunda Logs and/or the process
variables in Camunda's Cockpit.
